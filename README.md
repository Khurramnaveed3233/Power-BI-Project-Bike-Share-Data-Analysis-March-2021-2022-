 #Power BI Project: Bike Share Data Analysis (March 2021-2022)

 Excited to share my recent Power BI project where I analyzed 6M rides from a bike share service over a year (March 2021 - 2022). 

The dashboard provides deep insights into rider behavior and bike utilization trends, giving data-driven insights that can be used to optimize bike-sharing operations and improve customer experiences.

ðŸ“Š Key insights from the analysis:

Rides by Month: Bike usage peaked in July with over 0.4M rides and showed significant drops during the winter months (November - January), reflecting seasonal patterns.

Rider Type (Casual vs. Member): Members made up 55.17% of the total rides, while casual riders accounted for 44.83%. Understanding this can help focus membership marketing efforts to further engage casual users.


Rides by Bike Type: Electric bikes were the top choice, accounting for 67.07% of rides, with classic bikes coming in at 36.84%. This suggests that users prefer more efficient and faster electric bikes.

Rides by Weekday: The highest number of rides was recorded on Friday, with over 0.5M rides, indicating that weekends and end-of-week periods see the most activity.

Rides by Start Hour: The data reveals peak usage times around 5 PM, aligning with the evening commute, showing a high demand for bike-sharing during rush hours.

ðŸ“ˆ Impact & Business Value: These insights can help bike-sharing companies:

Optimize bike availability during peak seasons and rush hours.

Target marketing strategies for membership programs to convert more casual users into loyal members.

Enhance fleet management by investing more in electric bikes, which are the clear rider preference.

Improve service on Fridays and weekends, when rides are at their highest.
